#Which Pet and Breed Is Best?

Hi Cascabels!

You will find several directories in this repository (Cats, Dogs, Birds, Rabbits, Fish, Lizards).

Your task is to:
 * Clone this repository.
 * Create a branch for yourself.
 * Create a text file with your favorite breed of pet in the correct directory (i.e. - meissner_lop.txt in Rabbits). You can do several if you just can't decide.
 * Add, commit, and push this to your branch.
 * Open a pull request to integrate your branch into the main.
